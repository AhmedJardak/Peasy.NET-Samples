### A sample application

A full implementation of a middle tier built with peasy and sample consumer clients (WPF, Web API, etc.) can be found here.  You can clone the repo or download the entire project as a [zip](https://github.com/peasy/samples/archive/master.zip).

Once downloaded, open Orders.com.sln with Visual Studio, set the WPF project and Web Api projects as the startup projects and run.

More documentation on its way!
