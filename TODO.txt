Order State History - OrderStateHistory dto, service, etc.  Maybe remove order state change dates from OrderItem?

Add async support for business and validation rules

Add command execution context support.  This will allow loading and sharing of objects to be passed from rules to execution methods (both async and sync) which will eliminate redundant proxy calls.

The validation and business rules infrastructure is a bit smelly.  Figure out how to more easily create business rules and validation rules, or unify the interface and no longer expose ValidationResult, but use IRule and ValidationResult under the hood.

Add ability to opt in for all rule checking or short circuit business rules if validation rules don't succeed

BusinessBase - add concurrency business rule in update rather than throw concurrency exception?
