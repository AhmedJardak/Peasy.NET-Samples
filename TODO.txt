CustomerOrderView - Add an quantity on hand column and disallow adding items that exceed the QoH. 

Inventory functionality

Order State History - OrderStateHistory dto, service, etc.  Maybe remove order state change dates from OrderItem?

Backorder Functionality - Handle case where two orders are placed with the same item, but the first order to ship reduces inventory to that ordered item to zero.Need a way to notify system user and customer of backorder.

Shipping functionality

Add support to deny adding orderitems to an order that has been shipped

Complete delete order functionality

Create way to view order that has been shipped, but do not allow addition/modification of ordered items. Add Add/Edit on customer order title appropriately

Add concurrency support to repos and handle in UI accordingly

Need to add order item update rule that prevents changing if the order has shipped.

Add a rule or noneditable attribute to Order.CustomerID that prevents changing on update

Add price override functionality?



Add async support for business and validation rules

Add command execution context support.  This will allow loading and sharing of objects to be passed from rules to execution methods (both async and sync) which will eliminate redundant proxy calls.


Perhaps skip showing quantity on hand.  When you submit an order, it can change to ba:ck order state so that the order taker can notify the customer on submission.  Further, if attempting to ship an order item and the quanity on hand is zero, the state can be changed to back order as well.
