Order State History - OrderStateHistory dto, service, etc.  Maybe remove order state change dates from OrderItem?

Backorder Functionality - Handle case where two orders are placed with the same item, but the first order to ship reduces inventory to that ordered item to zero.Need a way to notify system user and customer of backorder.

Add concurrency support to repos and handle in UI accordingly

Support a cancel state?  This state would also replenish inventory in the case where the item is shipped and offered as an override feature for admin use

Does having Orders.com.Core and BLL serve any value.  Integrate all into BLL?

Prevent deletes for items with associations (customers, products, categories, etc.)

Increment inventory functionality


Add async support for business and validation rules

Add command execution context support.  This will allow loading and sharing of objects to be passed from rules to execution methods (both async and sync) which will eliminate redundant proxy calls.

The validation and business rules infrastructure is a bit smelly.  Figure out how to more easily create business rules and validation rules, or unify the interface and no longer expose ValidationResult, but use IRule and ValidationResult under the hood.

Add ability to opt in for all rule checking or short circuit business rules if validation rules don't succeed

BusinessBase - add concurrency business rule in update rather than throw concurrency exception?


Rename EF to Mock

Create true EF project

Create Web API project

Create Restful Proxies

Create Nuget packages

Create SPA web app consumer

Create tests for VM's and other framework - adding tests around VM's will ensure that future contributors who change the framework won't break the WPF app, revealing flawed logic

Add dynamic DI support to consumer projects
